abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures traditionally employ a grid-based approach to tokenization independent of the semantic content of an image. We propose a modular superpixel tokenization strategy which decouples tokenization and feature extraction; a shift from contemporary approaches where these are treated as an undifferentiated whole. Using on-line content-aware tokenization and scale- and shape-invariant positional embeddings, we perform experiments and ablations that contrast our approach with patch-based tokenization and randomized partitions as baselines.  We show that our method significantly improves the faithfulness of attributions, gives pixel-level granularity on zero-shot unsupervised dense prediction tasks, while maintaining predictive performance in classification tasks. Our approach provides a modular tokenization framework commensurable with standard architectures, extending the space of ViTs to a larger class of semantically-rich models.

## Background
The paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
